QEPANET brings EPANET to QGIS.

This plugin simplifies the use of EPANET (https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet) inside QGIS:

- it provides a wide set of tools to build and manage hydraulic networks (with topology enforcement);
- it can read EPANET INP files and rebuilds the networks inside QGIS;
- it can create an EPANET-compliant INP file to be used in EPANET
- it can run an EPANET simulation for you using the EPANET binaries;
- it provides tools to analyse and visualise the simulation results (showing graphs and thematic maps).
